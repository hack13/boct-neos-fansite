                    Welcome to Blood on the Clocktower in NeosVR, where we have tons of fun playing this amazing social deduction game in VR. The game is currently in its early
                     development stages (the VR version that is), but it hasn't stopped many people from joining in and playing. It is amazingly fun and several of us 
                     including myself have gone out and purchased the physical game as well to enjoy! Please go check out the Archive for the recordings of all previous games I 
                     was able to get a hold of and put together.

                    Please note, that this site is still in early development, and I am still making tons of changes to get it working properly for everyone. Please let me know 
                    if you have any recomendations or changes I should make. Again, this is just a big fan site for an amazing game, and record keeping of all the games we play. 
                    Nothing on this site is endorsed, sponsored, nor am I a part of NeosVR team that built this (Abnormally Rendered), nor the official Blood on the Clocktower itself.
